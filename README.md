We will fulfill three user stories:
- As a blog visitor,
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;
- As the blog author,
I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
So that I can notify them when new content is published;
- As a subscriber,
I want to be able to unsubscribe from the newsletter,
So that I can stop receiving email updates from the blog.



We will not add features to
- manage multiple newsletters;
- segment subscribers in multiple audiences;
- track opening and click rates.
